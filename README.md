# sequence-embeddings
These code files deal with various ways of extracting embeddings from sequences followed by their evaluation in terms of predicting the output

Three techniques were followed that included:
1. Sequence Graph Transform (SGT)
2. Autoencoder embeddings
3. LSTM model

The papers referred for each technique:
1. SGT- https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03533v5
2. Autoencoder- https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05597
3. LSTM- https://ur.booksc.eu/book/82230776/a4975b

Achieved upto **77%** accuracy in predicting the ouputs using these embeddings.
